This innovative song streaming app, crafted using React Native CLI, stands out for its unique approach,as this app does not use any third party api of prebuild api. It relies on a custom Node.js backend to dynamically fetch songs, scraping data from IMDb with Puppeteer. Using the ytdl library, the app automatically downloads songs from YouTube, saving them on Google Drive, and managing links in MongoDB Atlas. The tech stack encompasses React Native CLI for cross-platform compatibility, Redux for efficient state management, Node.js and GraphQL for the backend, MongoDB Atlas as the database, and Apollo for seamless frontend-backend communication. This well-integrated setup offers a cutting-edge, personalized streaming experience.
